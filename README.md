 - using `virtualenv` to manage python
 - after cloning, run in the current directory: `mkdir .env && virtualenv --system-site-packages .env` to setup python
 - run `source .env/biun/activate` and finally `pip install --upgrade tensorflow` to get cracking

## Current Projects
 - `mnist_softmax.py` which is copied from the tensorflow examples
 - `simpsons_classifier` (coming soon): which Simpsons character is in this photo?
